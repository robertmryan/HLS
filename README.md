#  HLS player

This is a quick demonstration of playing HLS with AVKit. The videos are from [Apple’s BipBox examples](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/examples/).

Note, this observes [`UIScreen.capturedDidChangeNotification`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscreen/2921652-captureddidchangenotification) to pause playback if the user starts screen recording on their device.
